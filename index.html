                        <p>Thad and J.C. graduated from high school together in 2011, after which Thad went to college and became a personal fitness instructor. As a high school athlete, he was always coached by someone else in the gym, and in college, he really discovered a love for coaching himself and others. Throughout college, he trained his roommates and friends, free of charge, in order to acquaint himself with the strategic programming required to build workouts and nutrition plans based on a myriad of lifestyles, needs, body types, and goals. After graduating from college as the strength and conditioning coach of the university’s club volleyball team, Thad moved to his hometown, where soon afterward J.C. asked if he’d be his personal trainer.</p>

                        <p>As a developer himself, J.C. describes how he was the first client of what would eventually become DevLifts:</p>

                        <blockquote> “ I was Client 0. Thad started training me in 2015. I was overweight, tired all the time, experiencing chest tightness from anxiety, lower back pain from sitting all the time, and I couldn't even go enjoy certain activities outdoors with my wife because I was terribly out of shape. He started training me, and 12 weeks later I was down 20 pounds, lost 13% body fat, put on about 15 pounds of muscle, and I could run circles around high school me. And it wasn't just quick results — he helped me learn how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I still go to the gym 4-6 days per week, depending on the type of training I’m doing. I’ve learned to love it so much (and love how I feel because of it) that I go even on days I don’t feel like going. I'm now working on getting certified as a personal trainer, too. Getting healthy changed my life, and I want to help other developers to experience that feeling, too. ” </blockquote>

                        <p>Thad spent the entirety of 2016 volunteering in children’s homes, refugee camps, and nonprofits throughout Asia and Europe, and having traveled to 21 countries to-date, he has developed his own practical, time-efficient travel workouts that keep him in shape, even without access to a traditional gym. </p>

                        <p>On his return to the States, Thad founded Black Owl Fitness, a private, in-home personal training service. As Thad and J.C. continued experimenting with various workouts and nutrition plans, they started to discover some of the muscular imbalances and deficiencies caused by the sedentary lifestyles of J.C. and the developers of his team.</p>

                        <p>The increased risk of various diseases and health issues is common knowledge, but as Thad began to examine further the damage done by a sedentary lifestyle on a biomechanical level, he discovered a host of musculoskeletal deficiencies that increase risk of injury so dramatically that they could very easily be debilitating, even in an otherwise healthy individual.</p>

                        <p>The response to this need was clear: developers need to be doing deadlifts. Thus, DevLifts was created in order to address the physical needs of the developer, from the perspective of a developer, with the expertise of personal trainers, to improve the developer’s quality of life.</p>

                              <h4>How is DevLifts different from existing fitness sites?</h4>
                              <p>Firstly, we're specialized. Everything we do revolves around helping you, the developer, achieve a healthier lifestyle. This means you benefit from a highly targeted approach and an encouraging, like-minded community to keep you going.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, no fluff. We're not here to waste your time or play games with you &mdash; we're here to help you feel better, look better, and live longer. And all our content will be published to that end.</p>
                              <p>Lastly, we hate ads just as much as you do. It's ridiculous how many times per day we as human beings are monetized, and we won't be a part of perpetuating that problem. We make money from memberships, not selling your personal information or dropping retargeting pixels into your browser. And if we recommend a product, it's because we truly believe it's awesome, not because we were paid to do so.</p>
                          </div>
                          <div class="text-block">
                              <h4>I’m not interested in becoming a bodybuilder. Is DevLifts for me?</h4>
                              <p>Yes! We will have plans suited for all sorts of goals and lifestyles. You set your goals. We're here to provide you with resources and motivation to achieve them.</p>

                              <h4>How is DevLifts different from hiring a personal trainer?</h4>
                              <p>Only in the ways it needs to be.</p>
                              <p><strong class="light-and-bold">Less expensive.</strong> Thad works as a traditional private trainer for his day job, and his lowest-paying client still racks up a $360/month bill.</p>
                              <p><strong class="light-and-bold">No chaperones.</strong> We get that it can be uncomfortable having someone look over your shoulder and chit-chatting while you’re trying to work out. That’s another beauty of DevLifts: all the expertise of a certified personal trainer &mdash; without the trainer.</p>
                              <p><strong class="light-and-bold">Community.</strong> Benefit from a community of like-minded developers who are on this journey with you. We haven’t met any personal trainers with membership forums or Slack channels.</p>
                              <p>If you're looking for something even more personalized (but without the babysitter), <a href="mailto:info@devlifts.io">contact us about our Premium membership</a>, which includes weekly scheduled calls and the maximum amount of personalization and attention we offer.</p>
